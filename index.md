Representing the Dirty South with Real Hip-Hop Energy

Welcome to atlquez.com, the official home of RocBoi Quez, an artist and songwriter who embodies the raw essence of Southern hip-hop. RocBoi Quezâ€™s music connects fans to an authentic and unfiltered experienceâ€”one built on real-life struggles, underground roots, and an undeniable passion for the culture.

The Journey: From Underground to Industry Recognition

RocBoi Quezâ€™s career began in 1999, coming up through the infamous TopNotch Records and M.A.P.U (Mentally Aware Production Unlimited), operated by industry pioneers Sedley Palmer and Big Hugh. He sharpened his skills under the mentorship of Turbo Korleon and Nodoz of ThugzNation (Fresh Off the Mothership), refining his artistry and business acumen in the streets and the studio.

Later, RocBoi joined forces with RayBooGotti to create the hip-hop duo PLAYCUZIN, where their raw chemistry and street anthems solidified their underground presence.

From the Streets to Stardom

RocBoi Quezâ€™s journey took a violent turn when he was severely injured in a gang-related shooting in College Park, Georgia, alongside his half-brother BigDawg of Wonderland Alumni Music Group. After surviving this near-death experience, he was later incarcerated in Marion State Prison, where he crossed paths with DoeBoy of FREEBANDZ and R.B.M.G Boss (Cleveland, Ohio). These hardships fueled his drive to elevate his artistry and command the industryâ€™s attention with his serious, passionate approach to music.

Building a Legacy: SLATTLAND Records & G Code Publishing

In 2020, RocBoi Quez launched SLATTLAND Records Inc., followed by G Code Publishing, creating a movement thatâ€™s impossible to ignore. His independent hustle and grind mentality have paved the way for major industry connections.

Now partnered with Bentley Records, RocBoi is securing celebrity features and expanding his influence, while also aligning with Equity Distribution and RocNation. With every release, RocBoi Quez continues to carve his name into hip-hop history.
