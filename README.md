This site connects music fans to an unparalleled hip-hop experience, blending the underground legacy with a modern, high-energy sound.

The Journey: From Underground to Industry Recognition

RocBoi Quez's journey started in 1999, deeply rooted in the underground hip-hop movement. His foundation was laid with the infamous TopNotch Records and M.A.P.U (Mentally Aware Production Unlimited), operated by industry figures Sedley Palmer and Big Hugh. Early on, RocBoi was mentored by the legendary Turbo Korleon and Nodoz of ThugzNation (Fresh Off the Mothership), gaining the knowledge and street credibility that would shape his career.

He later teamed up with RayBooGotti to form the hip-hop duo PLAYCUZIN, making noise in the underground scene with their undeniable chemistry and hard-hitting lyricism.

A Life-Changing Moment: From Tragedy to Triumph

RocBoi Quez's path took a dark turn when he was severely injured in a violent gang-related shooting in College Park, Georgia, alongside his half-brother BigDawg of Wonderland Alumni Music Group. Following this life-threatening incident, RocBoi also served time in Marion State Prison, where he crossed paths with DoeBoy of FREEBANDZ and R.B.M.G Boss (Cleveland, Ohio). These experiences led him to reshape his artistry, determined to make his mark with seriousness and passion that the industry couldnâ€™t ignore.

Building a Legacy: SLATTLAND Records & G Code Publishing

In 2020, RocBoi Quez took control of his career and established SLATTLAND Records Inc., followed by G Code Publishing, creating a platform to release his music independently while elevating the culture. His brand has continued to grow, earning respect from major industry players.

Now backed by Bentley Records, RocBoi Quez is working on solid celebrity features, strengthening his catalog while also aligning with Equity Distribution and RocNation for expanded reach. His dedication to crafting impactful music is pushing him further into the spotlight.
